# Jep-Clue-Grabber

This is a work in progress that allows me to grab Jeopardy clues from an online website (with respect to its servers) and then upload them to a m̶o̶n̶g̶o̶B̶D̶ ̶d̶a̶t̶a̶b̶a̶s̶e̶ now migrated to PostGres through SupaBase!
 
How to upload (Note this is locally on your computer)

1. Start the backend server in javascript_part (node index.js)
2. Edit the for loop indexes to a range of new games in automateboth.py
3. Run automateboth.py and then wait (python automateboth.py)
4. Check game_statuses to see if any errors happened
